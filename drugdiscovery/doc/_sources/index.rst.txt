Drugdiscovery - A deep learning platform for drug discovery
===========================================================

Drugdiscovery is a graph representation learning toolbox built on top of `PyTorch`_ platform.
It provides a comprehensive and flexible interface to support rapid protoyping of deep
learning models for graph structured data. Drugdiscovery covers latest models and benchmarks,
as well as approachable and extensible building blocks.
